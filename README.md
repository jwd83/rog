"All the remastered SC1 and SC2 sprites from the Timewarp project, 
graciously donated by Angelfish. Star Control TimeWarp is public domain 
according to their legal blurb, so it's free to use. Stil, the polite and 
courteous thing would be to credit the Timewarp project for any material 
you use. Unfortunately the actual names of the makers are lost in time."
