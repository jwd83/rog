## Timewarp by Angelfish

As of September 2019 at http://star-control.com/fan/resources.php

    All the remastered SC1 and SC2 sprites from the Timewarp project, 
    graciously donated by Angelfish. Star Control TimeWarp is public domain 
    according to their legal blurb, so it's free to use. Stil, the polite and 
    courteous thing would be to credit the Timewarp project for any material 
    you use. Unfortunately the actual names of the makers are lost in time.
    
StarControl was one of my favorite games as a child. I hope their fantastic art 
assets see use for decades to come.
